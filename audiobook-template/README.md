To make audiobook versions of the blogposts published on the [eka blog](https://medium.com/eka-foundation), please follow the following template:

* Begin the audio-book by reading the first (hopefully short) paragraph of your blogpost
* Post that, take a pause of two seconds, and speak the following text:
    * `This is the EKA foundation blog. To learn more about the EKA foundation, please visit eka.to`
* Post that, if you can insert a small 2-15 second audio sound that is relevant to the blog post, it might be good. For example, in the [OLPC blogpost](https://medium.com/eka-foundation/from-the-ashes-of-olpc-6aa3e3edfbae), I added the OLPC startup chime.
* Post that, take a pause of two seconds, and speak the title (and optionally the subtitle) of your blog post
* Post that, continue reading the rest of the blogpost till the end. 
* After you've reached the end, speak the following text:
    * `This was <your name> on behalf of the EKA foundation: A frontline think tank unlocking the human future of the internet`
* Optional - If you had inserted any audio or video elements in your blogpost, and they are openly licensed, you may want to insert them to the audiobook, if you think they are relevant.

On Linux, Audacity is a very good software to do this kind of audio editing.

After you have generated an audio mp3 file, please email Anish Mangal a link to access the file, so he can upload it to the [anchor.fm](http://anchor.fm) website.

[Here](https://anchor.fm/eka-foundation/episodes/Enmeshed-in-la-la-land-The-Long-Road----to-Apricots-e3c4gk) is a reference podcast which covers these elements.

Thats all folks!
